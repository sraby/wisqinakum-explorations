She even welcomes the raccoons and stray cats that come to visit. But a threat lurks underground. Her brick row house sits on top of a federal Superfund site: the Meeker Avenue Plume.","photoFileName":"100423_meeker_ave_superfund_1.jpg"},"slide2":{"slideContent":"The Environmental Protection Agency added the plume to its National Priorities List in 2022. A pool of chemicals in the groundwater and soil spans parts of Greenpoint and East Williamsburg in Brooklyn. The EPA wants to eventually clean up the area. {newParagraph} The main contaminants at the site are volatile organic compounds, namely tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE), as well as cis-1,2-dichloroethylene and vinyl chloride. {newParagraph} The state Department of Environmental Conservation first discovered the chemical contaminants in the mid-2000s, when it was monitoring the cleanup of the Greenpoint oil spill, a leak of at least 17 million gallons. {newParagraph} There are thousands of homes and hundreds of businesses on top of the plume, which presents an immediate risk: “People are potentially living with the effects in their own homes,” said Lael Goodman, environmental justice program manager of the nonprofit North Brooklyn Neighbors. {newParagraph} The EPA is conducting its own investigation to track down the extent of the plume’s contamination. New York State had already identified six former businesses as the culprits: two dry cleaners, a soap and lacquer manufacturer, a steel drum recycler and a pair of metal foundries.","photoFileName":"MAP"},"slide3":{"slideContent":"This summer, the EPA opened more than 300 wells scattered around the neighborhood to take groundwater samples to better understand the contaminants, their concentrations and locations.

The company used a slew of solvents and chemicals, including oils, primers, degreasers and paints. {newParagraph} The state found groundwater contaminated with TCE on the site, which was used by a succession of businesses for metal fabrication and painting from the 1930s until about 2000.","photoFileName":"201023_95Lombardyst_Krales_edit.jpg"},"slide5":{"slideContent":"The most immediate threat to people who live and work atop the plume is vapor intrusion. That’s when toxic fumes make their way from beneath the ground into buildings, where people breathe them in. {newParagraph} Even short exposures can result in watery eyes, itchy skin, nausea, dizziness or brain fog. Longer exposures can lead to a weakened immune system, damage to organs, including the liver and kidneys, or cancer.","photoFileName":"111523_meeker_plume_worker_1.jpg"},"slide6":{"slideContent":"As a result of climate change, sea levels will rise between 6 inches and over a foot by the 2030s, according to estimates by the New York City Panel on Climate Change. Water tables near the coast are also expected to rise. More intense and frequent rain, another fallout from climate change, can also raise the water table. {newParagraph} As the groundwater moves, it can cause the plume to change direction or rise, according to Kristina Hill, a professor of landscape architecture and environmental planning at the University of California, Berkeley.

People who live or work in basements or on ground floors are at the greatest risk.","photoFileName":"102323_greenpoint_plume_brennan_2.jpg"},"slide8":{"slideContent":"Over a decade ago, the state Department of Environmental Protection tested Christine Facella’s home for vapor intrusion. The state didn’t find anything, but installed a mitigation system just in case. It sends any vapors from the basement to a ventilation pipe on top of the roof. {newParagraph} “I've been assured that the mitigation system is enough to keep things safe,” Facella said.","photoFileName":"100423_meeker_ave_superfund_2.jpg"},"slide9":{"slideContent":"Before the EPA does its testing, the agency must get permission from property owners.
