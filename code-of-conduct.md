# Counter-cartographies of the Euphrates — Code of Conduct

## Introduction

*Counter-cartographies of the Euphrates* is a collaborative digital atlas dedicated to recounting the history, geography, and lived realities of the Euphrates rivershed through the voices of the people who know it best.

This platform is a public digital good — free, open-source, and accessible to anyone. It serves activists, scientists, environmentalists, academics, and members of the Iraqi diaspora. Most importantly, it seeks to be accessible and accountable to communities living in the Euphrates rivershed itself.

To foster an inclusive, respectful, and constructive environment, all contributors, users, collaborators, and community members agree to this Code of Conduct.
